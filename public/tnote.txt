inside pets.js import the instance you just created

create a function for each enpoint

one for getting all the pets
one for getting one pet by ID
one for adding a new pet
one for updating a pet by ID
one for deleting a pet by ID
In PetList.js call the api using useEffect and remove the petsData Its no longer needed pur data is now coming from the backend.
